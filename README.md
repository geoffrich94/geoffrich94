## Hi there 👋 

## 👩‍💻 About Me
My name is Geoffrey Richardson and I am a front-end developer based in London with 6+ years of experience building scalable, interactive web applications and also a 2:1 BSc in Digital Media Technology from Birmingham City University.
I take an engineering-first approach to front-end development, prioritising performance, code quality, and long-term maintainability.
I’m passionate about building engaging, innovative experiences inspired by video games, anime, art, and film.

## 🚧 What I’m Currently Working On
**BattleDBZ** – a turn-based battle RPG inspired by the Dragon Ball Z universe, built with **React** and **Redux**.
- Built **tactical, turn-based combat mechanics**, including stat-boosting consumables that affect both short-term outcomes and long-term strategy.
- Implemented **Redux-driven character selection and battle state**, with each character defined by unique stats and fully customisable move sets.
- Designed a custom **damage calculation system**, accounting for attack accuracy, critical hit probability, stat scaling, and randomness.
- Planning to introduce **real-time online multiplayer** using **WebSockets**.
This project focuses heavily on predictable state management, scalable game logic, and performance-conscious UI updates.
